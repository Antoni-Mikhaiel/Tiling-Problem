\begin{abstract}
The tiling problem seeks to count the number of ways a $2 \times n$ rectangular grid can be completely covered with $2 \times 1$ dominoes. This paper compares two algorithmic approaches: brute force backtracking and a recursive divide and conquer method. We describe and implement both methods, analyze their computational complexities, and experimentally evaluate their performance. Our results show that, for this problem, both approaches have exponential time complexity, but the divide and conquer (recurrence) method is often simpler to implement and reason about. Brute force guarantees all solutions by exploring every configuration, while the recursive approach leverages the problem's structure for a more concise solution. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each method in the context of the tiling problem.

\section{Introduction}
The tiling problem is a classic question in combinatorics and computer science: In how many ways can a $2 \times n$ rectangular grid be completely covered with $2 \times 1$ dominoes, placed either horizontally or vertically, without overlaps or gaps? This problem has applications in mathematics, physics, and algorithm design, and serves as a fundamental example of recursive problem solving.

\label{fig:tiling_example}
\end{figure}

As the grid length $n$ increases, the number of possible tilings grows rapidly, making exhaustive enumeration computationally expensive. Two common approaches to solving this problem are brute force backtracking and recursive (divide and conquer) methods. The brute force approach systematically explores all possible placements, guaranteeing that every valid tiling is counted. The recursive approach leverages the structure of the problem, expressing the solution for a grid of length $n$ in terms of smaller subproblems.

Although both methods have exponential time complexity for this problem, the recursive approach is often more concise and easier to implement, while brute force provides a direct way to enumerate all solutions. In this paper, we describe, implement, and compare both approaches, analyzing their strengths and limitations.

\section{Brute Force Approach}

The brute force approach to the domino tiling problem employs exhaustive search to enumerate all possible ways of placing dominoes on a $2 \times n$ grid. This method guarantees finding the optimal solution by systematically exploring every valid configuration through backtracking. While computationally expensive for large grids, the brute force approach provides a clear understanding of the problem's structure and serves as a baseline for comparing more sophisticated algorithms.

The fundamental principle behind this approach is to recursively place dominoes in all possible orientations (horizontal and vertical) at each empty position, maintaining the constraint that each domino must cover exactly two adjacent cells without overlapping with previously placed dominoes.

\subsection{Approach}

The brute force solution utilizes a recursive backtracking strategy that systematically explores the solution space. The algorithm maintains a $2 \times n$ boolean grid to track occupied cells and employs a depth-first search to place dominoes.

Key components of the approach include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State Representation}: A $2 \times n$ boolean matrix where \texttt{true} indicates an occupied cell
    \item \textbf{Decision Points}: At each empty cell, attempt both horizontal and vertical domino placements
    \item \textbf{Constraint Checking}: Ensure dominoes don't exceed grid boundaries or overlap existing placements
    \item \textbf{Backtracking}: Undo placements when no valid continuation exists
\end{itemize}

The algorithm begins at position $(0,0)$ and proceeds cell by cell, skipping already occupied positions. For each empty cell, it attempts to place a domino in both possible orientations, recursively solving the remaining subproblem.

\subsection{The Algorithm}

The implementation consists of several key components working together to enumerate all valid tilings. We break down the algorithm into logical components:

\textbf{Function Header and Parameters:}

The core recursive function is defined as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Function Signature}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{placeDomino}{$row, col, grid$}
\State {$row$: current row position to examine}
\State {$col$: current column position to examine}
\State {$grid$: reference to $2 \times n$ boolean matrix tracking cells}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The function takes three parameters: the current position coordinates $(row, col)$ and a reference to the grid state. The grid parameter is passed by reference to avoid copying overhead and to maintain state changes across recursive calls.

\textbf{Global Variables:}

The algorithm uses minimal global variables to maintain state across recursive calls:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Global Variables}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \texttt{const int ROWS = 2} \Comment{Fixed grid height}
\State \texttt{int tilingCount = 0} \Comment{Counter for valid tilings}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Cell Navigation Logic:}

The algorithm must efficiently find the next empty cell to process. This navigation ensures systematic exploration:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Finding Next Empty Cell}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\While{$row < rows$ \textbf{and} $grid[row][col]$}
    \State $col \gets col + 1$
    \If{$col = cols$}
        \State $col \gets 0$
        \State $row \gets row + 1$
    \EndIf
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This loop skips over already occupied cells, moving left to right within each row, then advancing to the next row.

\textbf{Base Case Detection:}

The recursive process concludes when every cell has been processed, signaling that a complete and valid tiling configuration has been achieved.:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Complete Tiling Detection}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$row = rows$}
    \State $tilingCount \gets tilingCount + 1$
    \State \textbf{return}
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Horizontal Domino Placement:}

For each empty cell, the algorithm first attempts horizontal placement if the adjacent cell is available:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Horizontal Placement}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$col + 1 < cols$ \textbf{and} $\neg grid[row][col + 1]$}
    \State $grid[row][col] \gets true$
    \State $grid[row][col + 1] \gets true$
    \State \Call{PlaceDomino}{$row, col, grid$}
    \State $grid[row][col] \gets false$ \Comment{Backtrack}
    \State $grid[row][col + 1] \gets false$
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Vertical Domino Placement:}

Similarly, the algorithm attempts vertical placement if the cell below is available:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Vertical Placement}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$row + 1 < rows$ \textbf{and} $\neg grid[row + 1][col]$}
    \State $grid[row][col] \gets true$
    \State $grid[row + 1][col] \gets true$
    \State \Call{PlaceDomino}{$row, col, grid$}
    \State $grid[row][col] \gets false$ \Comment{Backtrack}
    \State $grid[row + 1][col] \gets false$
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Main Function:}

The main function initializes the grid and starts the recursive exploration:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Main Function}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Main}{}
    \State \textbf{input} $n$ \Comment{number of columns}
    \State $grid \gets$ new boolean matrix of size $2 \times n$ initialized to \texttt{false}
    \State \Call{PlaceDomino}{$0, 0, grid$}
    \State \textbf{output} "Possible tilings: " + $tilingCount$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

\textbf{Time Complexity:} The brute force algorithm has exponential time complexity $O(2^n)$ because at each empty position, the algorithm explores up to two placement options (horizontal and vertical). The actual runtime is reduced by constraint checking and early pruning.

\textbf{Space Complexity:} The algorithm uses $O(n)$ space for the $2 \times n$ grid parameter and $O(n)$ space for the recursion stack, resulting in overall space complexity of $O(n)$.

\subsection{Step-by-Step Trace for $2 \times 2$ Grid}

To illustrate the process, consider the execution trace for a $2 \times 2$ grid:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Execution trace for $2 \times 2$ grid}
\label{tab:trace}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.0} % More dramatic spacing
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.7cm}|p{2.2cm}|p{1.8cm}|p{2.0cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Step} & \textbf{Action} & \textbf{Grid State} & \textbf{Result} \\
\hline
1 & Initial state & $\begin{pmatrix} F & F \\ F & F \end{pmatrix}$ & Start at (0,0) \\
\hline
2 & Try horizontal at (0,0) & $\begin{pmatrix} T & T \\ F & F \end{pmatrix}$ & Move to (1,0) \\
\hline
3 & Try horizontal at (1,0) & $\begin{pmatrix} T & T \\ T & T \end{pmatrix}$ & Solution 1 found \\
\hline
4 & Backtrack to (0,0) & $\begin{pmatrix} F & F \\ F & F \end{pmatrix}$ & Try vertical \\
\hline
5 & Try vertical at (0,0) & $\begin{pmatrix} T & F \\ T & F \end{pmatrix}$ & Move to (0,1) \\
\hline
6 & Try vertical at (0,1) & $\begin{pmatrix} T & T \\ T & T \end{pmatrix}$ & Solution 2 found \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textit{Note: T=True (occupied), F=False (empty)}


\section{Divide and Conquer Approach}

The divide and conquer approach to the domino tiling problem employs a recursive strategy that breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems. Unlike the brute force method that explicitly tracks grid states, this approach calculates the number of tiling configurations by recognizing patterns in how dominoes can be placed.

The fundamental principle behind this approach is to recognize that at any given column position, there are only two possible ways to begin filling the grid: either with a single vertical domino or with two horizontal dominoes stacked on top of each other. This observation leads to a simple recursive decomposition.

\subsection{Approach}

The divide and conquer solution utilizes a recursive strategy based on a recurrence relation that captures the structure of the problem. Rather than explicitly tracking the grid, the algorithm models the number of tiling configurations as a function of board length.

Key components of the approach include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem Decomposition}: Break down the $2 \times n$ grid into smaller subproblems
    \item \textbf{Choice Analysis}: At each column, analyze the two possible domino placement strategies
    \item \textbf{Recurrence Relation}: Express the solution in terms of smaller instances of the same problem
    \item \textbf{Base Cases}: Define the fundamental cases that terminate the recursion
\end{itemize}

The algorithm considers the leftmost column of the grid and determines the number of ways to fill it, then recursively solves the remaining subgrid. This approach eliminates the need for explicit grid state management and backtracking.

\subsection{The Algorithm}

The implementation consists of a single recursive function that captures the problem's structure. We break down the algorithm into its essential components:

\textbf{Function Header and Parameters:}

The core recursive function is defined as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Function Signature}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{divideAndConquerTiling}{$n$}
\State {$n$: the number of columns in the $2 \times n$ grid}
\State \textbf{returns}: integer count of possible tilings
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The function takes a single parameter representing the grid width and returns the total count of valid tilings.

\textbf{Base Cases:}

The recursion requires well-defined base cases to terminate properly:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Base Cases}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{$n = 0$}
    \State \textbf{return} 1 \Comment{Empty grid has exactly one way to tile (do nothing)}
\EndIf
\If{$n = 1$}
    \State \textbf{return} 1 \Comment{Only one vertical domino fits in a $2 \times 1$ grid}
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Choice Analysis:}

For any $2 \times n$ grid, we have exactly two ways to begin tiling:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Tiling Choices}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Choice 1}: Place one vertical domino in the first column
\State \Comment{This covers both cells in column 1, leaving a $2 \times (n-1)$ subproblem}
\State \textbf{Choice 2}: Place two horizontal dominoes (one in each row)
\State \Comment{This covers columns 1 and 2, leaving a $2 \times (n-2)$ subproblem}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Recurrence Relation:}

This analysis leads directly to the recurrence relation:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Recurrence Formula}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State $T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2)$
\State \Comment{Where $T(n)$ represents the number of ways to tile a $2 \times n$ grid}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Core Recursive Function:}

The main recursive function implements the recurrence:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Divide and Conquer Tiling Function}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{divideAndConquerTiling}{$n$}
    \If{$n = 0$}
        \State \textbf{return} 1
    \EndIf
    \If{$n = 1$}
        \State \textbf{return} 1
    \EndIf
    \State \textbf{return} \Call{divideAndConquerTiling}{$n-1$} + \Call{divideAndConquerTiling}{$n-2$}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Main Function Implementation:}

The main function demonstrates how to use the recursive approach:

\begin{algorithm}[htbp]
\caption{Main Function for Divide and Conquer}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Main}{}
    \State \textbf{input} $n$ \Comment{number of columns}
    \State $result \gets$ \Call{divideAndConquerTiling}{$n$}
    \State \textbf{output} "Number of ways to tile 2 × " + $n$ + " grid: " + $result$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

\textbf{Time Complexity:} The recursive algorithm has exponential time complexity $O(2^n)$ because each function call branches into two recursive calls, creating a binary tree of depth $n$. The actual runtime is determined by the number of overlapping subproblems.

\textbf{Space Complexity:} The algorithm uses $O(n)$ space for the recursion stack in the worst case, as the maximum depth of recursion is $n$.

\subsection{Step-by-Step Trace for $n = 4$}

To illustrate the divide and conquer process, consider the execution trace for a $2 \times 4$ grid:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Execution trace for $2 \times 4$ grid using divide and conquer}
\label{tab:dc_trace}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.8}
\begin{tabular}{|p{1.0cm}|p{2.0cm}|p{2.0cm}|p{1.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Call} & \textbf{Function Call} & \textbf{Recursive Breakdown} & \textbf{Result} \\
\hline
1 & $T(4)$ & $T(3) + T(2)$ & $3 + 2 = 5$ \\
\hline
2 & $T(3)$ & $T(2) + T(1)$ & $2 + 1 = 3$ \\
\hline
3 & $T(2)$ & $T(1) + T(0)$ & $1 + 1 = 2$ \\
\hline
4 & $T(1)$ & Base case & $1$ \\
\hline
5 & $T(0)$ & Base case & $1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Detailed Call Tree for $T(4)$:}

\begin{verbatim}
T(4)
├── T(3)
│   ├── T(2)
│   │   ├── T(1) → 1
│   │   └── T(0) → 1
│   │   └── Result: 2
│   └── T(1) → 1
│   └── Result: 3
└── T(2)
    ├── T(1) → 1
    └── T(0) → 1
    └── Result: 2
└── Final Result: 5
\end{verbatim}

\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented and compared two fundamental approaches to solving the domino tiling problem: brute force backtracking and recursive divide and conquer methods. Both approaches successfully address the challenge of counting valid tilings for a $2 \times n$ grid, but they serve different purposes and exhibit distinct characteristics.

The brute force approach provides a comprehensive solution by systematically exploring all possible domino placements through backtracking. While this method guarantees complete enumeration of all valid configurations, its exponential time complexity severely limits its practical applicability for large grid sizes. However, it remains valuable for understanding the problem structure and for applications requiring actual tiling patterns rather than just counts.

The divide and conquer approach transforms the combinatorial problem into an elegant mathematical recurrence relation that mirrors the Fibonacci sequence. This method demonstrates the power of recognizing underlying mathematical structures in algorithmic problems. When optimized with memoization, it achieves linear time complexity, making it highly efficient for counting tilings even for large values of $n$.

Our experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, showing that the optimized recursive approach significantly outperforms the brute force method for all tested grid sizes. The performance gap widens dramatically as $n$ increases, with the optimized approach maintaining constant-time performance while the brute force method becomes computationally prohibitive.

For practical applications, the choice between these approaches depends on the specific requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When only the count of tilings is needed, the optimized divide and conquer approach is strongly preferred
    \item When actual tiling configurations must be generated, the brute force approach remains necessary
    \item For educational purposes, both methods provide valuable insights into different algorithmic paradigms
\end{itemize}

This comparison highlights the importance of recognizing when a problem can be reduced to a well-known mathematical sequence or recurrence relation, as such insights can lead to dramatically more efficient solutions. The tiling problem serves as an excellent example of how mathematical elegance and computational efficiency can be achieved through proper algorithmic design.

Future work could explore hybrid approaches that combine the counting efficiency of the recursive method with selective enumeration capabilities, or investigate parallel implementations of the brute force approach to improve its scalability.
